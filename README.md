# RendererJS

> **Simple Yet Powerful Native JavaScript Rendering Library**

A lightweight software rendering library written in pure JavaScript. RenderJS, short for RendererJS, renders directly into a pixel buffer using the HTML5 Canvas API, giving you complete control over every pixel.

Perfect for learning graphics programming, building retro-style games, creating software renderers, or experimenting with 2D/3D rendering algorithms.

# Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RenderJS.git
```

Open the demo:

```text
demo/index.html
```

No build system is required.

Include it in Your Projects By:

```bash
<script src="RenderJs.js"><script>
```
Nothing else required!

---

# Basic Example

```html
<canvas id="screen"></canvas>

<script src="RenderJs.js"></script>
<script>
const canvas = document.getElementById("screen");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

Set_Size(ctx, 640, 480);

const screen = new RenderCanvas(640, 480);

clearRenderCanvas(
    screen,
    new Color(30,30,30)
);

drawCircle(
    screen,
    new Circle(80,320,240),
    new Color(255,0,0)
);

updateRenderCanvas(screen, ctx);
</script>
```

---

# Drawing Functions

## Pixels

```javascript
drawPixel(RenderCanvas, position, color);
```

Draws a single pixel.

---

## Lines

```javascript
drawLine(RenderCanvas, start, end, color, thickness);
```

Uses Bresenham's line algorithm.

---

## Rectangles

```javascript
drawRect(RenderCanvas, rect, color);
```

Draws a filled rectangle.

---

## Circles

```javascript
drawCircle(RenderCanvas, circle, color);
```

Draws a filled circle.

---

## Triangles

```javascript
drawTriangle(RenderCanvas, a, b, c, color);
```

Draws an outlined triangle.

```javascript
fillTriangle(RenderCanvas, a, b, c, color);
```

Draws a filled triangle using barycentric rasterization.

---

# 3D Utilities

RenderJS includes helper functions for simple 3D rendering.

### Projection

```javascript
project(point);
```

Projects a 3D point into normalized screen space.

### Screen Conversion

```javascript
screen(point, screenSize);
```

Converts normalized coordinates into screen pixels.

### Translation

```javascript
translate_z(point, distance);
```

Moves a point along the Z-axis.

### Rotation

```javascript
rotateX(point, angle);

rotateY(point, angle);

rotateZ(point, angle);
```

Rotate a point around the X, Y, or Z axis.

# 3D Model Loading (JSON)

RenderJS supports loading custom 3D models from a JSON file.

A model contains two arrays:

- `vs` → Vertex positions
- `fs` → Faces (arrays of vertex indices)

Each vertex is an object with `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates.

Example:

```json
{
    "vs": [
        { "x": -1, "y": -1, "z": -1 },
        { "x":  1, "y": -1, "z": -1 },
        { "x":  1, "y":  1, "z": -1 },
        { "x": -1, "y":  1, "z": -1 }
    ],

    "fs": [
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
    ]
}
```

## Loading a Model

```javascript
await loadModel("FILENAME.json");
```

The loader populates two global arrays:

- `cube` — Array of `Pos` objects representing the model's vertices.
- `edges` — Array of edge index pairs generated automatically from the faces.

Each face is converted into wireframe edges by connecting consecutive vertices and automatically closing the polygon.

For example, the face:

```json
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

produces the edges:

```text
0 → 1
1 → 2
2 → 3
3 → 0
```

Faces may contain any number of vertices (triangles, quads, or n-gons), allowing RenderJS to render arbitrary wireframe models.

# Classes

## Pos

```javascript
new Pos(x, y, z);
```

Stores a 3D position.

---

## Color

```javascript
new Color(r, g, b);
```

RGB color.

---

## Rect

```javascript
new Rect(width, height, x, y);
```

Rectangle primitive.

---

## Circle

```javascript
new Circle(radius, x, y);
```

Circle primitive.

---

## Screen

```javascript
new Screen(width, height);
```

Stores screen dimensions.

---

## RenderCanvas

```javascript
new RenderCanvas(width, height);
```

Creates an off-screen framebuffer backed by a `Uint8ClampedArray`.

---

# Rendering Pipeline

A typical rendering loop looks like this:

```javascript
clearRenderCanvas(buffer, backgroundColor);

// Draw your scene here

updateRenderCanvas(buffer, ctx);
```
